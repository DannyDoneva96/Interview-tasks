#This is Task From ChatGPT

##Create a webpage that displays a list of books retrieved from a public API (you can use any API that provides book data). The webpage should have the following features:

-A search bar that allows the user to search for books by title or author.
-The search results should be displayed in a list format.
-Each item in the list should display the book's title, author, cover image, and a short description.
-Clicking on an item in the list should display more detailed information about the book, such as the publication date, publisher, and ISBN number.

You can use any front-end technologies of your choice (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, etc.). You can also use any libraries or frameworks that you are comfortable with. Good luck!
